            <h3>Computer Games</h3>
            <p>I been interested in computer games since I was very young, well before I could adequately play them. I remember sitting on my dad's lap while he played
                one of the early versions of King's Quest,
                then a few years later watching him play Baldur's Gate and screaming at him when he got rid of Imoen.
            </p>
            <p>Baldur's Gate is still one of my favourite games, despite how old it is now. I like RPGs the most and
                will try almost anything in that genre. I prefer
                games set in the past versus anything space related. I played Everquest for many years, which I got into
                because of my dad.
                Before I quit I was the enchanter class lead for my raiding guid. I still miss my guild, but
                unfortunately the game was declining in quality and I had to stop.
                Now the game I play most often is World of Warcraft, where I'm slowly leveling a protection paladin.
