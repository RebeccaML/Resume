            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Computer Games</h3>
            <p>I've been interested in computer games since I was very young, well before I could adequately play them. I remember sitting on my dad's lap while he played
                one of the early versions of King's Quest,
                then a few years later watching him play Baldur's Gate and screaming at him when he got rid of Imoen.
            </p>
            <p>Baldur's Gate is still one of my favourite games, despite how old it is now. I like RPGs the most and
                will try almost anything in that genre. I prefer
                games set in the past versus anything space related. I played Everquest for many years, which I got into
                because of my dad.
                Before I quit I was the enchanter class lead for my raiding guid. I still miss my guild, but
                unfortunately the game was declining in quality and I had to stop.
                Now the game I play most often is World of Warcraft, where I'm slowly leveling a protection paladin.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>I've always loved music. I mostly listen to various forms of heavy metal and rock but I also enjoy classical music and the odd pop song.
                My favorite bands are Nightwish, Epica and Kamelot and I've seen them all live.
                </p>
                <p>I took piano and singing lessons for many years and I still enjoy both. I sort of learned guitar at school but I'd like to go back and get good at it,
                    and I'm also interested in learning to play the violin but... who has the time? :(
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Languages</h3>
                <p>I really enjoy learning languages. I learned Italian while I was in school, but I've unfortunately lost most of it from not studying since.
                    I started learning Spanish when I moved to the United States, and I'd say I'm at a basic conversational level when speaking/listening, but much higher when reading or writing.
                    I just find that Spanish speakers speak so quickly that I can't make out what they're saying. I'm sure one day I'll get it.
                </p>
                <p>I've also been learning Dutch, though I'm at a much lower level. My grandfather on my mother's side was from Holland, and he spoke multiple languages. I guess
                    I felt that having Dutch blood may make it easier to learn the language, but so far it's like any other. Some people may say Dutch is not a 'useful'
                    language, as most Dutch people speak decent English. I don't care, because I like the way it sounds, it's part of my heritage, and many of my favorite singers are Dutch.
                    So there.
                </p>
                <p>People think I'm crazy if I tell them all the languages I want to learn before I die so... I just won't.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>I like programming but that's probably obvious already. Before I begin - yes, I know HTML is not a programming language. It is a markup language.
                    But it's where I started. Back when all the cool kids were on MySpace, I was too (even though I wasn't really cool). I was also on VampireFreaks. Both those
                    sites let you customise your page using HTML and CSS, though I think VampireFreaks was more flexible. I used to change my theme every few weeks or so. 
                    Some of my background/text combinations were pretty bad looking back. I also liked having marquees everywhere.
                </p>
                <p>After high school I took some web development courses and received a Diploma in Website Devlopment. I learned HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. We only ever touched on JavaScript. I guess those were simpler times.
                    You'll notice I don't have PHP down as one of my skills. I was good at it, at the time, but I haven't touched it in ten years.
                </p>
                <p>I then completed my IT degree, where I learned Java, C++ and C#. Java is the only one I've really stuck with since graduation, though perhaps I'll revisit the others
                    at some point.
                </p>
                <p>Since graduating I have taught myself the new features in HTML5 and CSS3, a bunch of JavaScript and Python. I've been learning to make full stack web applications using
                    the MERN stack. I really prefer backend as I'm not particularly artistic. Python is my favourite programming language, replacing Java, though
                    I still think I'd like to work on my Java skills some time soon.
                </p>
                <p>I'm going to tell you a secret now - I hate JavaScript with a passion. The syntax is horrible. ES6 is even worse. Does it make things shorter? Sure.
                    But it's not very easy to read. I don't deny that it's a useful language, but it's ugly and I hate working with it.
                </p>
                <p>I have a few game ideas. I think I'll write them in Python despite some people saying it's not ideal for games. My starting ones will likely just be text-based anyway.
                    My first will probably be a Roguelike game since I recently found a tutorial for making one.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Baking</h3>
                <p>I really like cooking and baking but particularly the latter. I mostly bake bread. Freshly baked bread is one of the best things in the world.
                    I'm planning on making my own starter soon and baking sourdough, though my husband says he doesn't like it and if he doesn't like even <em>my</em>
                    sourdough then we will have a problem!
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Writing</h3>
                <p>I love to write. I mostly write fantasy/adventure type stories. I have upwards of 30 partially written stories. A few I think have potential, if I could
                    just get them finished! I have participated in NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) for the last few years, and reached my 50k word count target each time.
                    That is what lead me to being so very close to finishing one particular story. I just have to finish the final version as, especially when I'm pressured to write quickly,
                    there are often parts that have to be completely rewritten.
                </p>
                <p>I'm planning on turning some of my story ideas into games. I want to make a massive RPG as I think I could create a more compelling story than most that are out there.</p>
